Phase 1: Complete Database Schema Implementation
Step 1: Update Existing and Add New Tables
I'll update our PostgreSQL schema to reflect all your doctypes:

Update existing tables with additional fields:
vehicles: Add fields for is_active, driver
trips: Add fields based on your Trips doctype (handover_checklist, trip_pic, etc.)
driverAssessments: Add fields from your Assessment doctype
jobs: Update with fields from your Job doctype
Add new tables:
documents: For document storage (DL, Aadhar cards, etc.)
vehicleTypes: For vehicle type reference data
vehicleChecklists: For vehicle inspection items
driverAttendance: Track driver attendance
jobQuestions: Store questions for job postings
jobImages: Store images for job postings
jobApplications: Track job applications
jobHiredDrivers: Track hired drivers
driverFeed: For driver-focused content
transportersFeed: For transporter-focused content
reviews: Rating system for drivers and transporters
connectSettings: Application settings
shortUrls: URL shortener functionality
tripExpenses: Trip-related expenses
Step 2: Implement Data Types and Constants
Define enums and constants for:

Feed types (Apply, Blank, Register)
Job status (Pending, Approved)
Vehicle checklist item types
Assessment types
Phase 2: Storage Interface Implementation
Update our database storage interface to include methods for all tables:

Core Entity Management:
CRUD operations for Users, Drivers, Transporters
Document validation and verification
KYC management (DL, Aadhar, bank)
Job Management:
Job posting, editing, filtering
Application processing
Driver hiring
Trip Management:
Trip creation and tracking
Trip status updates
Expense tracking
Vehicle checklist management
Feed Management:
Content creation for drivers/transporters
Like/application tracking
Question and image management
Settings and Support:
App configuration management
URL shortening
Review system
Phase 3: API Implementation
Implement the following API endpoints based on your Postman collection:

User and Authentication:
/api/register: User registration
/api/verify-otp: OTP verification
/api/driver-profile: Driver profile management
/api/fleet-owner-profile: Fleet owner profile management
/api/user/:id: User details
Driver Directory:
/api/drivers-directory: List drivers with filtering
Filters: by availability, vehicle type, location proximity
Job Management:
/api/jobs: Create/list job postings
/api/job-applications: Job application management
/api/job-questions: Job question management
/api/job-images: Job image management
Trip Management:
/api/trips: Create/list trips
/api/trip-expenses: Manage trip expenses
/api/trip-checklists: Vehicle handover checklists
Vehicle Management:
/api/vehicles: Vehicle registration and listing
/api/vehicle-types: Vehicle type management
/api/vehicle-checklist: Inspection checklists
Attendance and Assessment:
/api/attendance: Driver attendance tracking
/api/assessments: Driver skills assessment
/api/driver-assessments/:id: Get specific assessment
Feed System:
/api/driver-feed: Driver-focused content
/api/transporter-feed: Transporter-focused content
Location Services:
/api/nearby-fuel-pumps: Find nearby fuel stations
/api/routes-with-tolls: Calculate routes with toll information
/api/service-locations: Find nearby services (hospitals, rest areas)
Reviews and Notifications:
/api/reviews: Submit and retrieve reviews
/api/notifications: User notifications
/api/read-notification/:id: Mark notification as read
Utilities:
/api/short-url: URL shortening service
/api/app-settings: Application settings
/api/document-verify: Document verification
Phase 4: Real-time Communication with WebSockets
Implement WebSocket communication for:

Trip Status Updates:
Real-time location tracking
Status changes (upcoming, waiting, running, completed)
Instant Messaging:
Driver-transporter chat
Message history
Notifications:
Job application updates
Trip assignments
Document verification status
Phase 5: Complete Schema Implementation
Let's start by updating our schema with the remaining tables. I'll implement them in groups:

Group 1: Document and KYC Management
Add documents table with fields for verification
Add vehicleTypes table
Enhance the drivers table with KYC fields
Group 2: Job-Related Tables
Enhance jobs table
Add jobImages and jobQuestions tables
Add jobApplications table
Group 3: Feed System
Add driverFeed and transportersFeed tables
Add reviews table
Group 4: Operations Tables
Add driverAttendance table
Add tripExpenses table
Add connectSettings table
Add shortUrls table
Phase 6: Testing and Deployment Strategy
Schema Verification:
Use Drizzle to push schema changes
Test relationships and constraints
API Testing:
Test each endpoint against Postman collection
Verify request/response formats
Integration Testing:
Test complete user flows (registration → job application → hiring)
Test real-time communication
Performance Testing:
Optimize database queries
Implement pagination for large data sets
Implementation Plan
I'll start with extending the schema, then implement the storage interface, and finally add the API routes. Here's the detailed step-by-step plan:

First, extend the schema with all the tables mentioned above
Create type definitions for all entities
Update storage interface with methods for new tables
Implement API routes for all endpoints
Add WebSocket support for real-time features
Test and deploy the complete solution
